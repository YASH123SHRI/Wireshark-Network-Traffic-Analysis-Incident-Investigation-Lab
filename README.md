# Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis & Incident Investigation Lab

## Overview

This project is a hands-on network traffic analysis and incident investigation lab built using **Wireshark**. The objective is to understand how different network protocols operate, analyze captured packets, identify suspicious network activities, and perform basic incident investigation from packet capture (PCAP) files.

The project follows a structured learning approach beginning with packet capture fundamentals and progressing towards real-world security investigations such as port scanning, brute-force attacks, suspicious traffic analysis, malware communication, and network incident reporting.

This repository demonstrates practical skills expected from entry-level SOC (Security Operations Center) analysts.

## Objectives

- Learn packet capturing using Wireshark
- Understand common network protocols
- Analyze TCP/IP communications
- Identify abnormal network behaviour
- Investigate common cyber attack patterns
- Practice packet filtering techniques
- Build basic incident investigation skills
- Create professional investigation reports
